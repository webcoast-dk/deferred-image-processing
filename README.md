# Deferred Image Processing - TYPO3 CMS extension

## What does it do?

The extension defers the image processing from during page generation to
when the image is actually requested from the client (browser). When the image
is processed and placed in the storage's processed folder, it will not be
processed again, until it is deleted or all processed images are cleared.

This is useful on sites with lots of images on one page.
Instead of generating one image after another, leading to a massive delay in
page generation speed, the image processing load is split to the available PHP
processes and thereby to multiple CPU cores.

## Installation & configuration

https://github.com/webcoast-dk/deferred-image-processing/blob/release/2.0/composer.json#L17-L18

The extension is available from packagist.org
```sh
composer require webcoast/deferred-image-processing
```
or from TYPO3 extension repository.

A database update is necessary to create the processing queue table.

### Rewrite rules for apache

If using the default htaccess file which is shipped with TYPO3, then there is a rule which stops all further processing
of static files which are not found:

```apacheconf
# Stop rewrite processing, if we are in any other known directory
# NOTE: Add your additional local storages here
RewriteRule ^(?:fileadmin/|typo3conf/|typo3temp/|uploads/) - [L]
```

But for this extension to process the request - if no prepared image was found - needs to be redirected to `index.php` and is then handled by the middleware on the fly.
So make sure to add a rule like this *before* the blocking rule above:

```apacheconf
  # EXT:deferred-image-processing
  RewriteCond %{HTTP_ACCEPT} ^image/
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteRule /_processed_/.+_([0-9a-f]{10})\.([a-z]+)$ %{ENV:CWD}index.php?dip[chk]=$1&dip[ext]=$2 [END]
```
URL/HASH ref. @ [`Resource/Processing/AbstractTask`](https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/12.4/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Resource/Processing/AbstractTask.php#L79-L103)

### Processing queue (optional)

Internally, a record for every deferred image is stored in the database table `tx_deferredimageprocessing_file`.
To clean up this table or speed up processing of lesser used files the records therein can be processed using a command controller or scheduler task.
This step is completely optional and not mandatory for the extension to work.

```shell
# Process limiting to 10 items
./typo3cms deferred_image_processing:process

# Process limiting to  5 items
./typo3cms deferred_image_processing:process 5
```

## Documentation

As the extension does everything itself automatically, there is no need
for further documentation. If you feel, a documentation could be helpful,
please contact me or open an issue with your question.

## Contributing
